## Input Dataset
The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing 4635 sequences. The average sequence length was 29819.915, with a standard deviation of 80.154. The earliest sample date was 2019-12-01, the median sample date was 2020-03-23, and the most recent sample date was 2020-05-21.

## Preprocessed Dataset
The input dataset was preprocessed such that sequences were given safe names: non-letters/digits in sequence IDs were converted to underscores. After preprocessing, the dataset contained 4635 sequences. The average sequence length was 29819.915, with a standard deviation of 80.154. The earliest sample date was 2019-12-01, the median sample date was 2020-03-23, and the most recent sample date was 2020-05-21.

## Multiple Sequence Alignment
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Minimap2 (Li, 2018). Each input sequence was aligned to the reference sequence (NC_045512), and the multiple sequence alignment was constructed based on positions in the reference. There were 29903 positions (213 invariant) and 4333 unique sequences in the multiple sequence alignment. Pairwise distances were computed from the multiple sequence alignment using the tn93 tool of HIV-TRACE (Pond et al., 2018). The average pairwise sequence distance was 0.000323, with a standard deviation of 0.000181.

Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment, the minimum coverage was 0.128, the maximum coverage was 0.999, and the average coverage was 0.983, with a standard deviation of 0.0416.

 Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment that had non-zero Shannon entropy, the minimum Shannon entropy was 0.00294, the maximum Shannon entropy was 1.0179, and the average Shannon entropy was 0.00993, with a standard deviation of 0.0431.

## Phylogenetic Inference
A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred under the General Time-Reversible (GTR) model (Tavare, 1986) using FastTree 2 (Price et al., 2010) using a Gamma20-based likelihood. The inferred phylogeny was MinVar-rooted using FastRoot (Mai et al., 2017). The tree was too large to draw.Pairwise distances were computed from the phylogeny using TreeSwift (Moshiri, 2020). The maximum pairwise phylogenetic distance (i.e., tree diameter) was 0.00505, and the average pairwise phylogenetic distance was 0.000381, with a standard deviation of 0.000208.

## Phylogenetic Dating
The rooted phylogeny was dated using LSD2 (To et al., 2016) using temporal constraints. The height of the dated tree was 0.00018 days, so given that the most recent sample was collected on 2020-05-21, the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was 2020-05-20. The tree was too large to draw.
## Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction
Ancestral sequence reconstruction was performed using TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018).
## Transmission Clustering
Transmission clustering was performed using TreeN93 (Moshiri, 2018) using pairwise phylogenetic distances. The total number of singletons (i.e., non-clustered individuals) was 2535, and the total number of clusters (excluding singletons) was 736. The average cluster size (excluding singletons) was 2.853, with a standard deviation of 2.0284, and the maximum and minimum cluster sizes were 30 and 2, respectively.
